# Aviation Incident Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Overview
This project explores aviation incident data to identify patterns, trends, and risk factors that could inform business recommendations for a company considering entering the aviation industry.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we investigate the distribution of injury severity, the most involved aircraft makes, incident trends over time, flight purpose impacts, and riskier phases of flight.

## Data
The dataset was sourced from aviation incident reports.
It includes fields such as:
Injury.Severity
Make (Aircraft Make)
Purpose.of.flight
event_year
Broad.phase.of.flight
The data was cleaned by handling missing values and mapping coded columns to readable labels for better interpretation.
## Analysis Summary

The following analyses were conducted:
Incident Severity Distribution: Frequency of different injury severity levels.
Top Aircraft Makes in Incidents: Aircraft brands most frequently involved in incidents.
Severity by Flight Purpose: Relationship between flight purpose (e.g., personal, commercial) and injury severity.
Incidents Over Time: Trends in the number of incidents per year.
Broad Phase of Flight vs. Severity: Injury severity distribution across different flight phases.

## Key Insights
Injury Severity: Most incidents involve minor or no injuries; fatal incidents are rare.
Aircraft Makes: Certain makes are more frequently involved, indicating a potential need for closer maintenance or model-specific risk mitigation.
Flight Purpose: Commercial flights show higher severity levels compared to personal flights.
Incident Trends: Incident frequency shows temporal patterns that could reflect improvements or challenges in aviation safety.
Flight Phase Risks: Takeoff and landing phases are associated with higher severity incidents.

## Recommendations
Focus on High-Risk Phases: Strengthen pilot training and technological support for takeoff and landing.
Fleet Safety Audits: Investigate and prioritize maintenance for frequently involved aircraft makes.
Commercial Flight Operations: Implement stricter safety protocols for commercial operations where severity risk is higher.
Safety Investments: Invest in predictive maintenance, advanced avionics, and real-time flight monitoring systems.
Regulatory Readiness: Ensure compliance with (and exceed) current aviation safety regulations to reduce liability and improve reputation.
