    "### Project Goal\n",
    "The objective of this project is to provide data-driven insights to support our company‚Äôs strategic expansion into the aviation sector. Using historical aviation accident data, we aim to identify aircraft models, manufacturers, or operational characteristics associated with lower risk profiles. These insights will inform purchasing decisions for both commercial and private aviation operations, helping the company enter this market with a strong understanding of operational safety and associated risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder\n",
    "The primary stakeholder is the head of the company‚Äôs new aviation division. This individual is responsible for assessing investment opportunities, mitigating operational risks, and selecting aircraft for acquisition. While technically proficient in business strategy, the stakeholder may not have a background in data science or aviation analytics. Therefore, our deliverables must translate complex data into clear, actionable insights that directly support business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "As the company looks to diversify its portfolio, the aviation industry presents both high potential and high risk. Aircraft safety, reliability, and accident history are crucial factors in evaluating which aircraft will provide the best return on investment with the lowest liability. Entering this space without understanding aviation risks could expose the company to avoidable costs, reputational damage, and operational setbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to reduce that uncertainty by analyzing over 60 years of aviation accident data, surfacing patterns and trends that can guide strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Business Questions\n",
    "To ensure the analysis aligns with business goals, we are focusing on the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which aircraft manufacturers and models have the lowest accident rates?**\n",
    "- **What operational or environmental factors (e.g., location, weather, time of day) correlate with increased risk?**\n",
    "- **How have accident trends evolved over time, and what insights can be drawn for future planning?**\n",
    "- **What recommendations can be made to prioritize safety and reliability in aircraft purchasing decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, this project will deliver three concrete business recommendations tailored to the needs of the aviation division, helping guide safe and strategic market entry.\n"

    "## Data Understanding\n",

    "### üìä Data Source & Context\n",
    "The primary dataset for this project comes from the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)**, a U.S. government agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation. The dataset spans over six decades, from **1962 to 2023**, and contains detailed information on civil aviation accidents and selected incidents occurring both **domestically (U.S.) and in international waters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data repository serves as a crucial record for analyzing aviation risk factors, operational safety, and the broader landscape of aircraft incident trends. For our business stakeholder‚Äîinterested in identifying low-risk aircraft for a potential fleet investment‚Äîthis dataset presents an invaluable opportunity to assess historical safety performance across aircraft types, manufacturers, and usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß≠ Dataset Structure & Key Features\n",
    "The dataset is rich in both breadth and depth, comprising thousands of records and dozens of attributes. Key categories of information include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Aircraft Specifications**\n",
    "- Aircraft make and model\n",
    "- Number and type of engines (turbine, piston, etc.)\n",
    "- Aircraft category (e.g., airplane, helicopter, glider)\n",
    "- Amateur-built status\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Accident Metadata**\n",
    "- Date and time of event\n",
    "- State and location of occurrence\n",
    "- Nature of flight (e.g., commercial, private, air taxi, instructional)\n",
    "- Summary of event (text-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Casualty & Injury Information**\n",
    "- Number of fatalities and serious injuries, disaggregated by crew and passengers\n",
    "- Number of uninjured individuals\n",
    "- Damage level to the aircraft (e.g., destroyed, substantial, minor)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Pilot and Operator Info**\n",
    "- Pilot certification and experience (total flight hours)\n",
    "- Operator type (e.g., airline, private individual, military)\n",
    "- Operation under Part 91, 121, or 135 of FAA regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Environmental Conditions**\n",
    "- Weather conditions (VMC/IMC)\n",
    "- Visibility, wind, precipitation, and lighting conditions\n",
    "- Phase of flight during the incident (takeoff, cruise, landing, etc.)\n",
    "\n",

    "### üîç Initial Observations & Data Challenges\n",
    "As with many large-scale, real-world datasets, this one presents a number of challenges that must be addressed before analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing or Null Values**: Critical fields such as pilot hours, weather conditions, and injury counts contain missing entries. Some of these may be imputable; others may require exclusion or careful interpretation.\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Text Formatting**: Variability in naming conventions (e.g., aircraft models and manufacturers) may require grouping or standardization to reduce noise.\n",
    "- **Free-Text Fields**: Narrative summaries and categorical fields often contain inconsistent phrasing, abbreviations, or misspellings, which could pose issues in aggregation or NLP-based analysis.\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: Certain aircraft or operators appear more frequently than others, potentially skewing risk metrics if not normalized properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßπ Planned Data Cleaning & Preparation Steps\n",
    "To ensure the integrity and clarity of our analysis, the following preparation strategies will be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardization**: Normalize date/time formats, categorical strings, and column names for uniformity.\n",
    "- **Imputation**: Apply appropriate imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, or flagging) for missing numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "  - Create **injury severity scores** or risk indices based on aggregated outcomes\n",
    "  - Derive **aircraft-level metrics**, such as total accident frequency per model or manufacturer\n",
    "  - Classify flights into **risk tiers** based on historical incident patterns and context\n",
    "- **Filtering & Sampling**:\n",
    "  - Focus on aircraft models with a statistically meaningful number of entries\n",
    "  - Consider date range filters to analyze recent vs. legacy aircraft trends\n",
    "  - Remove incomplete or unreliable records if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìà Business Value of the Data\n",
    "By leveraging this dataset, we aim to identify key patterns and correlations that can guide the company‚Äôs aviation division in making **informed, evidence-based acquisition decisions**. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pinpointing aircraft models and manufacturers with the **lowest historical accident rates**\n",
    "- Understanding which types of operations (e.g., private vs. commercial) or conditions (weather, time of day) are associated with **increased risk**\n",
    "- Offering **clear, quantitative risk comparisons** to support executive-level strategy on entering the aviation sector\n",
    "\n",
    "This data foundation sets the stage for deep, actionable insights and empowers leadership with clarity around which aircraft models represent the most viable, low-risk entry points into aviation operations.\n"
