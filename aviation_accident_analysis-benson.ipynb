    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "The objective of this project is to provide data-driven insights to support our company’s strategic expansion into the aviation sector. Using historical aviation accident data, we aim to identify aircraft models, manufacturers, or operational characteristics associated with lower risk profiles. These insights will inform purchasing decisions for both commercial and private aviation operations, helping the company enter this market with a strong understanding of operational safety and associated risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder\n",
    "The primary stakeholder is the head of the company’s new aviation division. This individual is responsible for assessing investment opportunities, mitigating operational risks, and selecting aircraft for acquisition. While technically proficient in business strategy, the stakeholder may not have a background in data science or aviation analytics. Therefore, our deliverables must translate complex data into clear, actionable insights that directly support business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "As the company looks to diversify its portfolio, the aviation industry presents both high potential and high risk. Aircraft safety, reliability, and accident history are crucial factors in evaluating which aircraft will provide the best return on investment with the lowest liability. Entering this space without understanding aviation risks could expose the company to avoidable costs, reputational damage, and operational setbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to reduce that uncertainty by analyzing over 60 years of aviation accident data, surfacing patterns and trends that can guide strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Business Questions\n",
    "To ensure the analysis aligns with business goals, we are focusing on the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which aircraft manufacturers and models have the lowest accident rates?**\n",
    "- **What operational or environmental factors (e.g., location, weather, time of day) correlate with increased risk?**\n",
    "- **How have accident trends evolved over time, and what insights can be drawn for future planning?**\n",
    "- **What recommendations can be made to prioritize safety and reliability in aircraft purchasing decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, this project will deliver three concrete business recommendations tailored to the needs of the aviation division, helping guide safe and strategic market entry.\n"
