    "# AVIATION ACCIDENT ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "The objective of this project is to provide data-driven insights to support our company’s strategic expansion into the aviation sector. Using historical aviation accident data, we aim to identify aircraft models, manufacturers, or operational characteristics associated with lower risk profiles. These insights will inform purchasing decisions for both commercial and private aviation operations, helping the company enter this market with a strong understanding of operational safety and associated risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder\n",
    "The primary stakeholder is the head of the company’s new aviation division. This individual is responsible for assessing investment opportunities, mitigating operational risks, and selecting aircraft for acquisition. While technically proficient in business strategy, the stakeholder may not have a background in data science or aviation analytics. Therefore, our deliverables must translate complex data into clear, actionable insights that directly support business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "As the company looks to diversify its portfolio, the aviation industry presents both high potential and high risk. Aircraft safety, reliability, and accident history are crucial factors in evaluating which aircraft will provide the best return on investment with the lowest liability. Entering this space without understanding aviation risks could expose the company to avoidable costs, reputational damage, and operational setbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to reduce that uncertainty by analyzing over 60 years of aviation accident data, surfacing patterns and trends that can guide strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Business Questions\n",
    "To ensure the analysis aligns with business goals, we are focusing on the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which aircraft manufacturers and models have the lowest accident rates?**\n",
    "- **What operational or environmental factors (e.g., location, weather, time of day) correlate with increased risk?**\n",
    "- **How have accident trends evolved over time, and what insights can be drawn for future planning?**\n",
    "- **What recommendations can be made to prioritize safety and reliability in aircraft purchasing decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, this project will deliver three concrete business recommendations tailored to the needs of the aviation division, helping guide safe and strategic market entry.\n"

    "##  Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), provides a comprehensive record of civil aviation accidents and selected incidents from 1962 through early 2023. This extensive temporal coverage gives us a longitudinal view of aviation safety trends across decades and allows for the identification of patterns in aircraft incidents and risks over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial inspection, the dataset contains **89 columns** and over **93,000 rows**, capturing a wide range of variables—from basic metadata like event IDs and dates to highly specific details such as aircraft engine types, damage extent, flight phases, and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations from the initial data exploration include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: Several columns contain a significant proportion of missing values. For instance, narrative fields like `weather_condition`, `injury_severity`, and `aircraft_damage` are sparsely populated in certain years. These will require careful imputation or exclusion based on relevance and completeness.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: Most fields are strings or categorical variables. Columns such as `injury_severity`, `aircraft_damage`, and `aircraft_category` will benefit from encoding for analysis.\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Columns**: Several columns (e.g., `investigation_type`, `report_status`, `publication_date`) may not be necessary for addressing the business problem and could be dropped to streamline analysis.\n",
    "- **Duplicate & Redundant Data**: Columns such as `make`, `model`, and `aircraft_serial_number` may appear redundant depending on the level of aggregation. Deduplication may be required after confirming their unique combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding forms the foundation for strategic data preparation and business-focused insights. Our next step is to clean and prepare the dataset to identify which aircraft types, conditions, and flight characteristics correlate most strongly with lower incident severity and frequency.\n"
